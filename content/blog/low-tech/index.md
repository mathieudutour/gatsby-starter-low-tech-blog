The internet consumes a lot of electricity. `416.2TWh` per year to be precise. To give you some perspective, that’s more than the entire United Kingdom.

From data centers to transmission networks to the devices that we hold in our hands, it is all consuming electricity, and in turn producing carbon emissions.

The average website produces `1.76 grams` of CO2 per page view. For a website with 10,000 monthly page views, that's `211 kg` of CO2 per year.

This blog only [produces `0.37kg` of CO2 per year](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/gatsby-starter-low-tech-blog-netlify-com/), or 570 times less than the average website. To do so, it leverages different techniques:

- no JavaScript. This website is static, it does not require any JavaScript to be displayed. This make every pages a lot lighter.
- no 3rd party tracking, no ads.
- every images is heavily compressed and black and white. This reduces the size of the images by as much as 80%.
- local cache. Once a user has visited the website, the pages are cached locally.

Obviously this website is _really_ simple, but the techniques used to make it greener can be generalized.
